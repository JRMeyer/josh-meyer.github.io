# Introduction

In what follows, you can find my tentative schedule for each day. There's a ton of cool stuff going on at this year's Interspeech, so I took the following approach:

First, I decided I'm going to focus on core end-to-end TTS and ASR technology, with a preference for TTS in the case of a tie.

Then, I went through the [schedule][schedule] and but a black box around all sessions that were most interesting to me.

Last, I took a last pass over the sessions and put stars next to the sessions I definitely don't want to miss.
